GFG(form a palindrome)

there is another problem in gfg qn. with similar name called "form a palindrome"

link of that qn. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/form-a-palindrome1455/1?itm_source=geeksforgeeks&itm_medium=article&itm_campaign=practice_card)

problem Statement:

Given a string, find the minimum number of characters to be inserted to convert it
 to palindrome.

For Example:
ab: Number of insertions required is 1. bab or aba
aa: Number of insertions required is 0. aa
abcd: Number of insertions required is 3. dcbabcd

Example 1:

Input:
abcd
Output:
3
Explanation:
Here we can append 3 characters in the 
beginning,and the resultant string will 
be a palindrome ("dcbabcd").
Example 2:

Input:
aba
Output:
0
Explanation:
Given string is already a pallindrome hence
no insertions are required.
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete
 the function findMinInsertions() which takes string S as input parameters and returns
  minimimum numser of insertions required.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|2)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|S|2)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 500
