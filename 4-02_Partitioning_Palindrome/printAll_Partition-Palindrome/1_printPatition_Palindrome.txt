problem statement:

Given a String S, Find all possible Palindromic partitions of the given String.
 

Example 1:

Input:
S = "geeks"
Output:
g e e k s
g ee k s
Explanation:
All possible palindromic partitions
are printed.
Example 2:

Input:
S = "madam"
Output:
m a d a m
m ada m
madam

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function 
allPalindromicPerms() which takes a String S as input parameter and returns a list of
 lists denoting all the possible palindromic partitions in the order of their appearance 
 in the original string.

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*2N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N2), where N is the length of the String

 

Constraints:
1 <= |S| <= 20
